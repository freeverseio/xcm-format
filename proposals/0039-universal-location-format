## Summary

The proposal aims to standardize a Universal Location Format (ULF) across different blockchain ecosystems. The goal is to facilitate a common method for decentralized applications (dApps) to reference assets (specifically NFTs) across various blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, Polkadot, Kusama, and others. The ULF will streamline the process of asset identification, retrieval, and interaction by providing a uniform, unambiguous string format for asset references.

## Motivation

As the blockchain space expands, the interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems has become paramount. Currently, each blockchain has its unique addressing system, leading to confusion and inefficiencies when referencing assets across platforms. The Universal Location Format (ULF) addresses this issue by providing a standardized, cross-chain referencing system. This format not only facilitates smoother asset management and dApp development but also promotes a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Adopting ULF will benefit developers, users, and the broader blockchain community by reducing complexity and enhancing the interoperability of digital assets across various platforms.

## Specification

The Universal Location Format (ULF) is defined as:

``` 
uloc://GlobalConsensus(networkId)/Parachain(paraId)/PalletInstance(evmPalletId)/AccountKey20(smartContractAddress)/GeneralKey(tokenId)
```


- **GlobalConsensus(networkId):** Identifies the network consensus, with networkId indicating specific blockchain networks as defined in the xcm-format.
- **Parachain(paraId):** (Optional) Required only for assets located in Parachains within the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
- **PalletInstance(evmPalletId):** Specifies the instance of the pallet where the asset is located.
- **AccountKey20(smartContractAddress):** Represents the address of the smart contract managing the asset.
- **GeneralKey(tokenId):** The unique identifier of the asset within the smart contract.

This format is in line with the XCMv3 format and adheres to the hierarchical nature of the MultiLocation structure used in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Examples

- Ethereum NFT: `uloc://GlobalConsensus(7)/AccountKey20(0xabc....def)/GeneralKey(666)`
- Parachain in Kusama: `uloc://GlobalConsensus(3)/Parachain(2023)/PalletInstance(51)/AccountKey20(0xabc....def)/GeneralKey(666)`

## Security Considerations

Security is a paramount concern in the design of the ULF. The format is constructed to minimize ambiguity and prevent address collisions. However, it's essential to consider the following:

- The proper validation of ULF strings to prevent injection attacks or reference to malicious contracts.
- Ensuring that the ULF adheres to the security protocols of the individual blockchains it references.
- Regular audits and updates in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities in the blockchain space.

## Impact

Adopting the ULF involves changes in how dApps reference assets across blockchains. It necessitates updates in dApp development practices and possibly minor adjustments in existing smart contracts to support ULF. However, the long-term benefits in terms of interoperability and ease of asset management outweigh the initial adoption overhead.

## Alternatives

Alternatives such as continuing with blockchain-specific addressing were considered. However, they lack the universality and interoperability that ULF offers. While ULF adoption requires initial effort, the lack of a universal standard perpetuates inefficiencies and hinders the blockchain ecosystem's growth.

## Questions and Open Discussions (optional)

- Feedback on the ULF structure and its compatibility with various blockchain ecosystems.
- Suggestions for the seamless integration of ULF into existing blockchain infrastructures.
- Discussion on potential improvements or extensions to the ULF to cover more use cases and assets.

## Reference

Initial discussions and considerations regarding the Universal Location Format (ULF) can be found in the GitHub issue: [freeverseio/laos/issues/177](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos/issues/177). This issue laid the groundwork for the development and standardization of the ULF, addressing the need for a unified asset referencing system across different blockchain ecosystems.
